# ReKon64s_Ammo
This mod will eventually be split into ReKon64s_Ammo and ReKon64s_Tweaks so whoever decides to use my mod will be able to just get the ammo without the tweaks.
Note: Everything that has (TBI) near it's name means that I have almost completed making it or that it's easy to implement for me. I might be wrong about the latter part sometimes so just please bear with me :)
# Custom Content
- +P+ Ammo variant - Mix between AP and HiPower ammo. It costs a bit more gunpowder but is always available to craft at the chemstation
- Dragons Breath Rounds - Where it all started for me. Shotgun ammo that is a bit more pricey but has a slightly higher damage and sets enemies on fire for 30s. 
Note: Due to my skill issues this ammo applies the same buff as all other incendiary ammo variants and will not run separate damage calculation.
- .308 caliber - I removed the ability to fire 7.62 ammo from all the sniper rifles / rifles governed by the Deadeye perk.
I's pretty damn expensive but it deals a whole lotta more damage than 7.62mm and has an additional HS bonus that usually will do enough damage to kill anything in one headshot. Neat ey? This ammo also has a +P+ variant but lacks HiPower and AP versions. I will add them eventually
- HE Rocket(TBI) -  Vanilla Rockets have been renamed to Explosvie rockets. This Rocket variant has about twice the AOE effect but is HELLA pricey and also doesn't do much damage against blocks, for that you will need a 
- Nuke(TBI) - Sadly this doesn't create temporary radiation zones and probably never will(Though I do have some ideas on how to implement a similar feature). This monstrosity destroys pretty much everything and because of this will require a LOT of testing from my side so I can find the middle ground between not burning your computer and achieving a result worthy of Oppenheimers speech.
- Napalm Rocket(TBI) - This is basically molotov but better, not a lot of damage on impact but it sure as hell sets a large area on fire for a long time. Will also annihilate wood based structures
- Box mag (TBI). M60 only attachment - 180 Ammo in the mag regardless of weapon quality. Reduces your mobility quite heavily and increases reload time dramatically.
Penalty gets heavily reduced with each level of Machine Gunner perk with higher levels reducing the penalty even further. 

#Balance 
I intend to balance the whole Tweak mod around the idea that weapons are super effective when used with higher levels of perks, great with some skill points invested and barely usable without them depending on the IRL difficulty to operate the weapon properly. For example, a SMG will be easier to use than a Pistol and Magnum will be even harder. I want to balance it around weapon kick, accuarcy ,spread to a smaller degree and reload times ,maybe mobility. I think that regulating damage via skill levels is idiotic however I probably will refrain from overhauling the skill point system in that departament.

# Tweaks
- Pistol - Pistol can now have a drum mag attached.
- Autoshotgun - Lowered spread, more balanced kick. RPM set to 140 (default is 70 which makes it feel like a pump action operated by a toddler)
- Shotgun Shells - Less spread, 20 block max range, 15 block falloff range.
- Slugs - Increased range
- MP5SD (SMG) - Now works as god intended. It is silenced by default, Lower spread, less random recoil and RPM increased to 800 to match it's IRL counterpart ,it also has a faster reload time to balance for it's relatively small damage(This may change due to my relatively small experience with this weapon. See the balancing note). This also means that it no longer can have other barrel attachments installed.
- Satchel / Timed charges - Enourmous increase in block damage. I m not done with this item yet.
- Magnum and DV - Zero spread and drastically increased kick and also headshot damage.
